## Document Structure

The paper is organized as follows:

1. **Introduction** — Motivation and contributions
2. **Setup** — PLR model, DML estimator, condition number definition
3. **Theory** — Linearization and coverage error bound
4. **Conditioning Regimes** — Well/moderately/severely ill-conditioned
5. **Simulation Evidence** — Monte Carlo design and results
6. **Discussion** — Practical recommendations and extensions

## Dependencies
